## My process

I did not really have a build process I felt I could follow because I felt so inexperienced. I tried to keep things structured at first but found myself jumping all around without knowing how things would go together. Future challenges where I develop some experience will allow for a more structured approach.

1. Began with HTML and layed structure.
2. Added CSS properties I know to get stuff showing up on screen and using font & colors from style guide. Began CSS with mobile layout first.
3. Because of still learning flexbox I found it helpful to go add some temperary background colors to all the different flexboxes so I could keep things straight in my head and beable to get immediate visual of how things change from different properties and settings.
4. I went back over and over again to keep adjusting margins and padding.
5. Applied background to body which was another area I took a lot of time reading documentation and learning.

Additionally I had to learn markdown for this particular section. This, as well as 3, 4, 5 and 6 I think I will vastly improve upon in terms of time. Most of my time was spent in these areas where I felt I was wasting a lot of time. I have yet to get more experience using Github pages where my projects will be hosted.

### Built with

- Using old Photoshop (GIMP would work too but I have an old Photoshop copy around) for working with design images, getting some approximate measurements and making comparisons.
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Regular CSS properties including Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main thing I am working on is practicing my CSS. I welcome any feedback about poor habits or styling that are apparent.

I learned a little more about CSS. I knew I was not great at CSS and just doing this made me more comfortable about working with CSS.

This project took me about 5 days of about 3 hour sessions. I think future projects will go much faster especially as I learn what to do.  
I already know a couple things to prepare before hand that took a lot of time going back and forth needlessly. Using guidelines, get all distances which become widths, heights, margin and padding mostly. I should get all those first before starting CSS. Would save a lot of time, days of trial and error positioning.

A neat trick I came up to compare my positioning was to take a screen clipping, paste it over the preview images provided and making it less opaque, so it is just a translucent overlay I could compare spacing and text size to. It is not pixel perfect method, but I felt it was close enough and helpful.

### Continued development

Some stuff I want to continue developing is just a sense of converting visuals to code. I am not a visual designer and do not want to be. I want to be able to work with visual designers. Want to keep efficient non-bloated code.

Two new things I used in CSS were border-radius and box-shadow. I have little intuition about how to use them, so there are two properties I want to use more.

If I have good suggestions for changes to improve my web development or this project itself I will continously update. I may complete an another version of this project utilizing CSS grid but that is not something I have even tried to use yet.

### Useful resources

- [Video of solution to the challenge](https://youtu.be/uaM5F8O_VI8) - I didn't watch entire video, I just wanted to know I was on track. There was one instance in designing the layout for the purchase area that was similar to what I was already thinking might work so seeing some else do similar was reinsuring.
-[CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/?fbclid=IwAR3michooiyBKhjow5Z8RJhEXsTXY8PM7Y1d1gmYHSRZWrgSs7_bXL-khws) - This flexbox guide really helped for reference in terms of using flexbox for layout.
-[CSS Units Best Practices](https://gist.github.com/basham/2175a16ab7c60ce8e001) - I kept obsessing over what units I should be using for everything and this article was what I stuck most too.
-[Principles of writing consistent, idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css) - I worry about how to organize my CSS in some standardized way. It is a developing area of practice, however this article has the standards I am trying to adhere to.

All of following were articles on MDN that I spent a lot of time reviewing since I was not comfortable in my understanding of any of these areas.
